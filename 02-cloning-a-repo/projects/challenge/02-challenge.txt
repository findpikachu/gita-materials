Chapter 2 - Challenge Solution

The goal of this challenge is twofold:

a. Create a fork of the ideas repository under your own user account on GitHub.
b. Clone the forked repository to your local system.

This involves a few steps:

1. Fork the **ideas** repository under your own personal user account.
2. Find the clone URL of your new, forked repository.
3. Clone the forked **ideas** repository to your local system.
4. Verify that the local clone created successfully.
5. Bonus: Prove that you’ve cloned the fork of your repo, and not the original repository.

Here are the steps to follow to complete this challenge:

Forking the repository:

- Log in to GitHub with your personal account.
- Go to the ideas repository at https://www.github.com/raywenderlich/ideas.
- Click the "Fork" button on the repository homepage.
- Wait while GitHub creates a fork of the repository.
- When the fork has been created, you’ll be taken to the new repository homepage.

Cloning the fork:

- Click the "Code" button, and get the HTTPS URL to clone the repository.
- Go to your command prompt, and navigate to the main GitApprentice directory if you’re not already there.
- run "git clone https://www.github.com/<your-username>/ideas.git"

Verify the clone created successfully:

- Navigate into the newly created "ideas" directory with "cd ideas".
- Use "ls" to see that the file structure you expect is there.

Bonus: Prove you’ve cloned the fork, and not the original

- This one may take a bit of Googling. The git command "git remote" will help you out here.
- While inside the "ideas" directory, execute the command "git remote -v".
- This will show you the origin of your local clone: https://www.github.com/<your-username>/ideas.
